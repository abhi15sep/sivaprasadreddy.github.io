      <description>Having some fun is absolutely necessary in these COVID-19 times to relax a bit :-) In the final round of interview when the the interviewer told you that you will be working on building a microservices based platform and you can help in setting up infrastructure using Kubernetes too, if you are interested&amp;hellip;    After joining when they put you in a 15 year old project and start assigning low priority bugs opened in 2008&amp;hellip;    While onboarding the HR folks singing how a cool a typical day in their organization is and that engineering manager showing you how agile their work culture is&amp;hellip;    When you show your quick prototype and business folks liked it and asked you to make sure it works fine on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE11 and be ready to give a demo by Friday and went on to dance floor&amp;hellip;    Those senior developers who neither gets excited about new technologies nor worry to work on JSF 1.</description>

      <description>A year ago I was in Germany (Berlin) and it was a beautiful Saturday evening. I was alone and feeling bored. Then I suddenly remembered about a book my friend recommended to me, specifically one particular story. I picked up the book and start reading the story my friend suggested.
  After reading the story I had no words, no thoughts&amp;hellip;nothing. I was just sitting there without any thoughts or emotions for few minutes.</description>

      <description>I am so excited to meet my old friend Vinay after a long time. It has been almost one and half year we spoke to each other. We worked together in one of my previous organizations and he is a close friend and kind of mentor to me too. We both got busy in our lives and we are not in touch lately. I am so happy to meet him after a long time.</description>

      <description>Few months ago&amp;hellip; Its Saturday. I woke up at 5.30 AM as usual. I know exactly what to do today because I usually plan what I will do next day. Today I planned to learn about AWS and Terraform.
Todo List
1. Learn AWS &amp;amp; Terraform  After morning routine activities I was skimming through my Twitter timeline. Somebody posted a link to his blog post about Azure which is gaining more popularity in recent times.</description>

      <description>We want better. We always want to get better things in life..better job, better house, better living standards etc. In the process of getting better we pursue new career options, make new life choices. And, we hope with our new choices our life will get better.
But, most of the times we forget one thing.
 Every choice we make might bring some positive things into our life and also bring some new challenges.</description>

      <description>I was doing my under graduation in 2001. One day the lecturer was absent and we were all talking loud, making lot of noise. Then our correspondent came to the class to engage.
He asked us one question Whom do you like the most?
Each of us gave different answers such as &amp;ldquo;I like Megastar Chiranjeevi&amp;rdquo;, I like &amp;ldquo;My mother&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I like Sridevi&amp;rdquo; etc etc.
After all the students expressed who is their favorite person, he said So, none of you like yourself!</description>
