      <description>Having some fun is absolutely necessary in these COVID-19 times to relax a bit :-) In the final round of interview when the the interviewer told you that you will be working on building a microservices based platform and you can help in setting up infrastructure using Kubernetes too, if you are interested&amp;hellip;    After joining when they put you in a 15 year old project and start assigning low priority bugs opened in 2008&amp;hellip;    While onboarding the HR folks singing how a cool a typical day in their organization is and that engineering manager showing you how agile their work culture is&amp;hellip;    When you show your quick prototype and business folks liked it and asked you to make sure it works fine on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE11 and be ready to give a demo by Friday and went on to dance floor&amp;hellip;    Those senior developers who neither gets excited about new technologies nor worry to work on JSF 1.</description>
